Provided model is Vensim model file entitled "ANEMI_Yangtze.mdl". This file can be opened using the Vensim software to view the model structure. 
A free Vensim PLE licence can be obtained from https://vensim.com , which can be used to view the stock and flow diagram that makes up the model 
structure. Due to the advanced features used in the ANEMI_Yangtze model, a Vensim DSS license is required to run the model.  The ANEMI_Yangtze.mdl 
is already set with the input data for the base run. No more data or action is needed. All the user has to do is open the model, click on the button 
to run the model and obtain the base run simulation results.
